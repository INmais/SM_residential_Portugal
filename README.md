# SM_residential_Portugal



## üìä Energy Dataset ‚Äì HAN Interface from E-REDES
Smart meter eletricity data collected through HAN port for residential sector in Portugal. Each Parquet file corresponds to one calendar month of continuous data collection and is organized by timestamp, measurement channel, and device identifier.

### üìÅ Test Files Provided

Two datasets examples are available for testing and demonstration purposes:

1. **Longitudinal Dataset:**

   * Contains **multi-month data** from **two individual consumption points** .
   * Suitable for **time series analysis**, device-level profiling, and behavioral modeling.

2. **Cross-sectional Dataset:**

   * Contains **two months of data** from **dozens of consumption points**.
   * Suitable for **comparative studies**, cluster analysis, and anomaly detection across users.
